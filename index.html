                                Operating Systems, Parallel Computing, C and Assembly Programming, CPU Data Path design, 
                                error-correcting codes and much more.

                                        deals with memory allocation techniques, pointer manipulation, and gdb debugging.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>ML classifier built in RISC-V assembly</b>: 
                                        implementing matrix operations like matrix multiplication, exponentiation, etc. in the 
                                        RISC-V assembly language.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><b>CPU data path digital design</b>:
                                        designing a single-cycle and pipelined processor using only basic logic gates, flip flops,
                                        and multiplexers(DMEM is abstracted away), and then testing it by running custom RISC-V 
                                        files.
                                    </li>

                                        using thread-level and data-level parallelism, as well as cache-blocking to implement highly
                                        optimized matrix operations in C.

                            <p>Directly advised by Professor Ronald Fearing, I am leading a team of undergraduates
                                to develop a network of underactuated, intelligent robots that cooperate 
                                to overcome tasks otherwise unattainable by a singular, well-equipped robot. 
                                This research is working to show that sample efficient reinforcement learning policies,
                                like online Model Predictive Control and Model-Based Meta RL, provide the ability for a single model to not only
                                generalize across inconsistencies between robots, but also allow for the robot to adapt 
                                to the environment and achieve tasks without need of system identification. Details on this are featured in the "Projects" 
                                section.

                            <p>I spent four years traveling the world, playing music with my friends. Growing up listening
                                to punk rock, I always dreamt of being in a band myself, but never expected that I would
                                have the opportunity to travel as a result of it. Out of love for the music, we found a way to 
                                grow as an artist in a financially broken music scene, and pave our own path, eventually
                                leading to US and international tours. This experience taught me a lot about the DIY mindset
                                and is still a fundamental aspect of my identity today.

                    <p>Outside of my regular work, I enjoy anything that gets me out of the house. 
                        Typically it's summitting a new peak, or swimming in the ocean. I also 
                        gravitate towards any sport that involves a ball, but mainly the white ones 
                        with red laces.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When I'm home, I love a good woodworking project. I've built 
                        my desk, entertainment center, benches and bedframes. Of course, most design 
                        choices are credited to my woodshop supervisor Cricket(featured below).</p>

                                    end-to-end Reinforcement Learning, communicate on a ROS network to push or pull objects in their 
                                    environment that would otherwise be impossible for a single robot to achieve.

                                    Learning methods like Model Predictive Control and Model-Based Meta-RL, these robots can move
                                    an object to a target location or through a desired trajectory by implicitly learning their own 
                                    dynamics and the characteristics of their environment. In addition to this impressive performance,
                                    our sample efficient policy drastically cuts down on the training data required for a dynamics model
                                    of this type. The most comparable literature to our work, by <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05253.pdf">A. Nagabandi et al</a>,
                                    uses a dataset on the order of 10 thousand samples whereas we are able to achieve exceptional performance with
                                    as little as 10 samples

                                            transmits these packets to a reciever, which then is decoded and reconstructed.

                                            very few people stop to question the magic at our fingertips. This project is an exploration 
                                            into signal processing and communications, with lots experimental design along the way. Everything
                                            is coded from scratch(except Huffman Encoding - thank you MIT).

                                            <b>How: </b>Animated PNG files are transformed from RGB to Luma/Chroma channels and then processed
                                            separately. Using the 3D discrete cosine tranform, 3D laplacian quantization, and spiral, 
                                            zero run-length, and Huffman encoding, the video is converted to byte code. This byte code is partitioned
                                            into APRS packet format and transmitted in NRZI byte stream. The reciever then uses a phase lock loop to
                                            detect the data stream and invert all encoding.

                                    <p><b>Compression: </b>240:1 (2.4MB to 10kB)</p>
                                    <p> <b>Takeaway: </b>The goal of this wasn't to perfectly recreate the original video, but to find the limits of compression in which
                                        the recovered video is fairly close to the orginal but much much more efficient to transmit. This project taught 
                                        me alot about communications and signal processing design. I had to learn many experimental video encoding 
                                        techniques and made numerous experimental choices that ultimately did not improve my modellike PCA, frame differencing, 
                                        motion detection, to name a few. But what's important is that I learned what works, and what doesn't, 
                                        and how to take experimental concepts and apply them.

                                            <b>What: </b>In response to NASA's Big Idea challenge, this project was to propose and design a solution
                                            to the dilemma of traversing permanantly shaded regions(PSRs) of the lunar surface. We worked under 
                                            alongside Professor Philip Lubin and adapted some of his work on directed energy as well as some of our 
                                            own research to make it a viable solution.

                                            <b>Why: </b>The lunar surface is known to contain ice and could some day be used as a rocket refuel station
                                            for deep space missions, greatly preserving fuel on Earth-based launches. The problem is that the Moon's ice
                                            is mainly in PSRs(deep craters of the polar regions), meaning that solar powered rovers are no longer an 
                                            option. Thus there is a big energy dilemma and few ways to successfully and affordably study the ice of the 
                                            lunar surface.

                                            at the rim of a crater collecting sunlight and directing energy to the recieving rover below, which deploys
                                            of its own for power supply.

                                    <p><b>Takeaway: </b>This project posed many difficult challenges for our team to attempt to find solutions to. This project was a

                                        design in general. We were ultimately eliminated from the challenge for having an overly ambitious design and
                                        righfully so. This was my first extracurricular research experience and showed me the beauty of space engineering and
