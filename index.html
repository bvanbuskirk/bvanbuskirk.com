                            <p>Directly advised by Professor Ronald Fearing, I am currently working 
                                on a network of underactuated and intelligent robots that can cooperate 
                                on tasks that are otherwise unattainable by a singular, well equipped 
                                robot. This research aims to show that swarm robotics can be the solution 
                                to most difficult problems in robotics, while keeping the design 
                                affordable for the average consumer. Details on this are featured 
                                in the "Projects" section.</p>

                    <p>Outside of my regular work, I enjoy anything that gets me out of the house. 
                        Typically it's summitting a new peak, or swimming in the ocean. I also 
                        gravitate towards any sport that involves a ball, but mainly the white ones 
                        with red laces.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When I'm home, I love a good woodworking project. I've built 
                        my desk, entertainment center, benches and bedframes. Of course, most design 
                        choices are credited to my woodshop supervisor Cricket(featured below).</p>

                                            <b>What: </b> A custom modem that compresses animated PNG files and using APRS packet format,
                                            transmits these packets to a reciever, which then is decoded and reconstructed.

                                            <b>Why: </b>Every day we use devices that seamlessly transmit and recieve information and 
                                            very few people stop to question the magic at our fingertips. This project is an exploration 
                                            into signal processing and communications, with lots experimental design along the way. Everything
                                            is coded from scratch(except Huffman Encoding - thank you MIT).

                                            <b>How: </b>Animated PNG files are transformed from RGB to Luma/Chroma channels and then processed
                                            separately. Using the 3D discrete cosine tranform, 3D laplacian quantization, and spiral, 
                                            zero run-length, and Huffman encoding, the video is converted to byte code. This byte code is partitioned
                                            into APRS packet format and transmitted in NRZI byte stream. The reciever then uses a phase lock loop to
                                            detect the data stream and invert all encoding.

                                    <p><b>Compression: </b>2.4MB to 10kB</p>
                                    <p> <b>Takeaway: </b>The goal of this wasn't to perfectly recreate the original video, but to find the limits of compression in which
                                        the recovered video is fairly close to the orginal but much much more efficient to transmit. This project taught 
                                        me alot about communications and signal processing design. I had to learn many experimental video encoding 
                                        techniques and made numerous experimental choices that ultimately did not improve my modellike PCA, frame differencing, 
                                        motion detection, to name a few. But what's important is that I learned what works, and what doesn't, 
                                        and how to take experimental concepts and apply them.

                                            <b>What: </b>In response to NASA's Big Idea challenge, this project was to propose and design a solution
                                            to the dilemma of traversing permanantly shaded regions(PSRs) of the lunar surface. We worked under 
                                            alongside Professor Philip Lubin and adapted some of his work on directed energy as well as some of our 
                                            own research to make it a viable solution.

                                            <b>Why: </b>The lunar surface is known to contain ice and could some day be used as a rocket refuel station
                                            for deep space missions, greatly preserving fuel on Earth-based launches. The problem is that the Moon's ice
                                            is mainly in PSRs(deep craters of the polar regions), meaning that solar powered rovers are no longer an 
                                            option. Thus there is a big energy dilemma and few ways to successfully and affordably study the ice of the 
                                            lunar surface.

                                            <b>How: </b>Our model is a system of two cooperative rovers. One with a laser and solar cells that remains
                                            at the rim of a crater collecting sunlight and directing energy to the recieving rover below, which deploys
                                            of its own for power supply.

                                    <p><b>Takeaway: </b>This project posed many difficult challenges for our team to attempt to find solutions to. This project was a 
                                        transformative experience for me as a Sophmore and taught me so much about insulation, power systems, optics, and
                                        design in general. We were ultimately eliminated from the challenge for having an overly ambitious design and
                                        righfully so. This was my first extracurricular research experience and showed me the beauty of space engineering and 
                                        science for the first time.
